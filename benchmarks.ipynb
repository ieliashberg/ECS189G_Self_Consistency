Initially, he was at an angle of 450. tan 45 = h/distance between car and tower. h = distance between car and tower (since tan 45 = 1).\\nNow, after 10 minutes, it travelled a certain distance, and angle changed to 600.\\ntan 60 = h/x x = h/√3\\nSo, in 10 minutes, it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h/√3.\\n10 minutes = h *( 1 – 1√3)\\nh can be travelled in 10 / (1 – 1√3).\\nTo travel a distance of x, which is h/√3, it takes :\\nh = 10 / (1 – 1/√3)\\nh / √3 = 10/ √3 * (1 – 1/√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √3 ( conjugate of 1 - √3). We get, x = h/√3 = 10 (1 + √3) / 2 = 5* (1 + √3)\\nSo, it takes 5(1 + √3) minutes to reach the base of the tower.\\nAnswer : A', 'correct': 'A'}\n",
